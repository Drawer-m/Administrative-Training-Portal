## üë©‚Äçüíª Development Approach

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Component-Based Structure**: The application is built with a modular component architecture to maximize reusability and maintainability.

2. **Context API for Theme Management**: React's Context API powers the theme switching and accessibility features, allowing for global state management without prop drilling.

3. **Responsive Design**: The interface uses responsive design principles with Material-UI's Grid system and media queries to ensure a seamless experience across all device sizes.

4. **Mock Data Integration**: Where appropriate, the application uses carefully crafted mock data to simulate a complete experience without requiring a full backend implementation.

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works with baseline technology, while enhanced features are provided when available.

### Accessibility Considerations

- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard navigability throughout the application
- **Theme Options**: Light, dark, and high-contrast themes for different visual needs
- **Text Customization**: Font size, family, and spacing adjustments
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order

## üîç Future Enhancements

- Integration with backend systems for permanent data storage
- User management with different permission levels
- Advanced analytics with machine learning insights
- Batch training data upload functionality
- Multilingual support for the chatbot interface
